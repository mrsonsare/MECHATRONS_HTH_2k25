# 🏠 Smart Home Automation with ESP32, ESPHome & Home Assistant  

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates a **smart home automation system** using **ESP32 microcontrollers with relays** as nodes and a **Raspberry Pi 5 running Home Assistant** as the central hub.  
The ESP32 boards are programmed with **ESPHome**, allowing seamless integration with Home Assistant for monitoring, controlling, and automating home appliances.  

Our goal is to provide a **low-cost, scalable, and open-source solution** for smart homes without depending on expensive proprietary systems.
