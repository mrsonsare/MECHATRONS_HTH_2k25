\# 🏠 Smart Home Automation with ESP32, ESPHome \& Home Assistant  



\## 📌 Overview  

This project demonstrates a \*\*smart home automation system\*\* using \*\*ESP32 microcontrollers with relays\*\* as nodes and a \*\*Raspberry Pi 5 running Home Assistant\*\* as the central hub.  

The ESP32 boards are programmed with \*\*ESPHome\*\*, allowing seamless integration with Home Assistant for monitoring, controlling, and automating home appliances.  



Our goal is to provide a \*\*low-cost, scalable, and open-source solution\*\* for smart homes without depending on expensive proprietary systems.

\## 🔧 Features  

\- ✅ Control appliances (lights, fans, switches) via \*\*Home Assistant Dashboard\*\*  

\- ✅ Real-time status monitoring  

\- ✅ Idle-time safety notification (e.g., iron left ON too long)  

\- ✅ Automation rules \& scheduling (e.g., lights on at sunset)  

\- ✅ Local control (no cloud dependency)  

\- ✅ Expandable with more ESP32 relay nodes  

\- ✅ Works with voice assistants (Google Assistant / Alexa) if enabled
